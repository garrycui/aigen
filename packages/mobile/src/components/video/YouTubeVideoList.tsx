/*
 * YouTubeVideoList Component - DEPRECATED
 * 
 * This component has been replaced by FullScreenVideoList for an immersive video experience.
 * The app now uses a TikTok-style full-screen interface instead of card-based video lists.
 * 
 * If you need to restore card-style video lists in the future, you can find the original
 * implementation in git history.
 * 
 * Current video components:
 * - FullScreenVideoList: Immersive full-screen video experience (active)
 * - VideoRecommendationsScreen: Main video screen controller
